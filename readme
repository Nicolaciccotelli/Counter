The project was carried out after studying the basics of Javascript.

It is a simple HTML counter that has been styled with CSS and features with Javascript.
Everything is based on two functions (add and subtract) that allow you to manipulate the number.
In addition, the number cannot go below zero and go negative.
I hope it will be useful to you...
